## Introduction
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark for image classification tasks. This project uses a deep learning model to classify images into 10 categories, including airplanes, cars, birds, and more. By leveraging CNNs, this project aims to demonstrate high performance in classifying these images with high accuracy.

## Dataset
- **Name:** CIFAR-10
- **Classes:** 10 (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck)
- **Training Samples:** 50,000
- **Test Samples:** 10,000
- **Image Size:** 32x32 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB)

## Model Architecture
The CNN model is built using the Keras Functional API, comprising multiple layers:
- **Input Layer:** Accepts images of shape (32, 32, 3)
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract features from the images using filters with ReLU activation
- **Pooling Layers:** Downsample feature maps to reduce computational complexity
- **Dropout Layers:** Prevent overfitting by randomly setting input units to 0
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Perform the final classification with softmax activation

## Training
The model is trained with the following configurations:
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss Function:** Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- **Metrics:** Accuracy
- **Early Stopping:** Stops training if validation loss does not improve for 3 epochs
- **Data Augmentation:** Applied to increase dataset diversity and model robustness

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated on the test set to measure its performance. Performance metrics include:
- **Accuracy:** Percentage of correctly classified images
- **Loss:** Measure of prediction error in classification

## Results
| Metric         | Training Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| CNN Model      | 90%               | 88%           |

## Installation
To run this code locally, install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Load the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Preprocess the images by normalizing the pixel values.
3. Train the model using the defined CNN architecture.
4. Evaluate the model on the test dataset.
