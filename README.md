## Introduction:
Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and the CIFAR-10 dataset serves as a standard benchmark to test image recognition models. The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more. Each category poses its own challenges due to the diversity and complexity of real-world images.

In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model has been implemented using TensorFlow and Keras to effectively classify these images into their respective classes. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image processing because they can capture spatial hierarchies in data through layers of convolutional filters, pooling, and activation functions. By employing CNNs, this project demonstrates how deep learning techniques can achieve high accuracy in recognizing and classifying images. 

## Dataset:
- **Name:** CIFAR-10
- **Classes:** 10 
- **Training Samples:** 50,000
- **Test Samples:** 10,000
- **Image Size:** 32x32 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB)

## Model Architecture:
The CNN model is built using the Keras Functional API, comprising multiple layers:
- **Input Layer:** Accepts images of shape (32, 32, 3)
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract features from the images using filters with ReLU activation
- **Pooling Layers:** Downsample feature maps to reduce computational complexity
- **Dropout Layers:** Prevent overfitting by randomly setting input units to 0
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Perform the final classification with softmax activation

## Training:
The model is trained with the following configurations:
- Optimizer
- Loss Function
- Metrics
- Early Stopping
- Data Augmentation

## Evaluation:
The model is evaluated on the test set to measure its performance. Performance metrics include:
- Accuracy
- Loss 

## Results:
| Metric         | Training Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| CNN Model      | 90%               | 88%           |

## Installation:
